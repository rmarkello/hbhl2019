To learn more about some of the software packages used for analysis take a look at [`snfpy`](https://github.com/rmarkello/snfpy), which implements similarity network fusion, [`pypmi`](https://github.com/rmarkello/pypmi), which can be used to preprocess data from the [Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative](https://www.ppmi-info.org/) (PPMI), and [`netneurotools`](https://github.com/netneurolab/netneurotools), which has lots of fun plotting and statistical utilities.
